 I am an electrical engineer with a deep passion for large engineering projects, especially power transmission and generation. My background in electrical power systems and transmission has allowed me 
 to acquire a solid understanding of this specialty. In addition, my interest in scientific visualization and computer graphics has led me to explore how to transform technical data in my field into 
 understandable and value-generating graphs and algorithms. 
 
 My ambition is to contribute to the evolution and integration of new transmission systems, applying my knowledge and passion to develop projects that drive a greener energy future.
